# CS_Type: Facts
The counterspeaker tries to persuade by correcting misstatements. 

Example: “Actually  homosexuality  is  natural. Nearly all known species of animal have their gay communities.  Whether it  be  a  lion  or  a  whale,  they  have  or  had (if  they  are  endangered)  a  gay  community.  Also  marriage is  an  unnatural  act.  Although  there  are  some  species  that do have longer relationships with a partner most known do not”

# CS_Type: Hypocrisy
The counterspeaker points out the hypocrisy or contradiction in the user’s (hate) statements. In order to discredit the accusation, the individual may explain and rationalize their previous behavior, or if they are persuadable, resolve to avoid the dissonant behavior in the future.

Example: “The ‘US  Pastor’  can’t  accept  gays  because  the  Bible  says  not to  be  gay.  But...he  ignores: The  thing  about  eating  shrimp or  pork,  The  thing  about  touching  the  skin  of  a  dead  pig (Football), The thing about mixing fabrics, The thing about torn clothes, The thing about tattoos, The thing about planting two crops in one field, The thing about working on the Holy Day (Saturday or Sunday depending)...for any and all of those sins one should burn for an eternity, yet is ignored. But when it comes to loving the wrong person (gays) this will not do! Christians only follow the parts of the bible that supports their bigotry. YOUR A HYPOCRITE.” 

# CS_Type: Consequences
The counterspeaker warns the user of possible consequence sof  their actions.  This  can  sometimes  cause  the  them to retract from their original opinion. 

Example: “I’m not gay but nevertheless, whether You are beating up someone gay or straight, it is still an assault and by all means, this preacher should be arrested for sexual harassment and instigating!!!”

# CS_Type: Affiliation 
Affiliation  is  “...establishing,  maintaining,  or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person  or  group  of  persons”  (Byrne  1961).  People  are  more likely to credit the counterspeech of those with whom they affiliate,  since  they  tend  to  “evaluate  ingroup  members  asmore  trustworthy,  honest,  loyal,  cooperative,  and  valuableto the group than outgroup members”   (Kane, Argote, andLevine 2005). In the dataset used in this study, counterspeakers who use Affiliation received the highest number of likes for their comments among all of the counterspeech types.

Example: “Hey I’m Christian and I’m gay and this guy is so wrong. Stop the justification and start the accepting. I know who my heart and soul belong to and that’s with  God:  creator  of  heaven  and  earth.  We  all  live  in  his plane of consciousness so it’s time we started accepting one another.  That’s  all”  

# CS_Type: Denouncing
The  counterspeakers  denounce  the  message  as  being  hateful. This strategy can help the counterspeakers in reducing the  impact  of  the  hate  message.

Example: “Please take this down YouTube. This is hatespeech.”

# CS_Type: Humor
Humor is one of the most powerful tools used by the counterspeakers to combat hate speech. It can deescalate conflicts and be used to garner more attention toward the topic. Humor in online settings also eases hostility, offers support to other online speakers, and encourages  social  cohesion  (Marone  2015).  Often,  the  humor  is sarcastic.

Example: “HAHA-HAHAHAHAHAH...oh  you  were  serious.  That’s  even  funnier :)”. 

# CS_Type: Positive
The  counterspeaker  uses  a  wide  variety  of tones to respond to hate speech. In this strategy, we consider different forms of speech such as empathic, kind, polite, or civil. Increasing empathy with members of opposite groups counteracts  incitement

Example:  “I  am  a  Christian, and I believe we’re to love everyone!! No matter age, race, religion, sex, size, disorder...whatever!! I LOVE PEOPLE!! We are not going to go anywhere as a country if we don’t put  God  first  in  our  lives,  and  treat  EVERYONE  with  respect”.
